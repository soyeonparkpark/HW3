1.What code draws the blades of grass?
var x = 0; var h = 10;

function draw() { stroke(random(70, 70), 100, 90); line(x, height-10, x+random(-10, 10), height-10-random(h));

noStroke();

x = x + 10;

if (x > width) { x = random(10); h = h + 3; }

}

2.What code makes the "lawnmower" come by? How often does it come by?
if (random(100) > 99.9) { fill(255); rect(0, 0, width, height-15); h = 10; }

3.What's the point of the h variable? h = 10;

4.What does the -10 do in the second and fourth arguments of the line function, height-10-random(h) ? Why is it there?
Randomizing a height of the grass
